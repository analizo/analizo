=head1 DESCRIPTION

analizo is a suite of source code analysis tools, aimed at being
language-independent and extensible. The 'analizo' program is a wrapper for the
analizo tools, which do the real work, so most of the time you'll be using one
specific tool among the available ones. See TOOLS below for more information.

=head1 TOOLS

analizo has several individual tools that share a core infrastructure, but do
different analysis and produce different output. They are normally invoked like
this:

  analizo <tool> [tool-options] <tool-args> [<tool-args> ...]

Although you can invoke analizo tools against one or few files inside a project,
normally it only makes sense to run it against the entire source tree (e.g.
passing "." or "./src" as input directories).

The options and output are specific to each tool, so make sure to read the
corresponding manual for the tool(s) you want.

Run B<analizo> withtout any command line arguments to see the list of available
tools.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following are the options for the wrapper analizo script. The options for
each tools are documented in the respective tool's manual page.

=over

=item --version

Displays version information and exits.

=item --help

Displays the manpage for the 'analizo' script or any analizo 'tool'.

=item --usage

Displays the only usage of the named tool, instead of display its manpage.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

Analizo can be configured in a per-project way by means of a file called
I<.analizo> in the current directory. The syntax for this file is: one line per
tool, each line has the tool name, a colon and one or more command line
options:

  <tool-name>: OPTIONS

When you run an analizo tool from inside that directory, it will load
I<.analizo> and act as if the options specified there were actually passed to
it in the command line. Note that options in the command line will override any
options in configuration files, though.

Example:

  metrics: --language cpp
  graph: --modules

You can store a file like that in the root directory of your project. Every
time you run B<analizo metrics> from that directory, it will only consider C++
code. When you run B<analizo graph> from that directory  it will use the
I<--modules> option.

=head1 HISTORY

Analizo started as a modified version of egypt, by Andreas Gustafsson
(available at http://www.gson.org/egypt/ as of the time this is being written).
But since then so many features were added (and removed) that at some point
during October 2009 it felt like it wasn't egypt anymore, and a new name was
needed. The project was then renamed to Analizo, which means "analysis" in
Esperanto.

It was also relicensed under the GPL version 3. This relicensing was possible
because the license of the original egypt allows that: "the same terms as Perl
itself" mean either Artistic License or GPL version 1 or later.
