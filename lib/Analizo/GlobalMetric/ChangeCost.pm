=head1 NAME

Analizo::GlobalMetric::ChangeCost - Change Cost global metric

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The metric calculation is based on the following article and calculates the
degree to which a change to any file causes a (potential) change to other files
in the system.

Article: Exploring the Structure of Complex Software Designs: An Empirical
Study of Open Source and Proprietary Code by Alan MacCormack, John Rusnak and
Carliss Baldwin.

See the paragraph about Change Cost in the article:

"... characterize the structure of a design is by measuring the degree of
'coupling' it exhibits, as captured by the degree to which a change to any
single element causes a (potential) change to other elements in the system,
either directly or indirectly (i.e., through a chain of dependencies that exist
across elements).

... measures the percentage of elements affected, on average, when a change is
made to one element in the system."
