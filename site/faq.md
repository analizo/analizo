# Frequently asked questions

## Which metrics does analizo support?

Analizo supports a large number of metrics, and at each version released it may
get support for new metrics. Because of that, the safest way to know which
metrics are supported by the version you have installed is by running:

```
$ analizo metrics --list
```

The above command will list all metrics supported, both module-level and
project-level metrics.
