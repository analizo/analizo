Feature: mapping modules to filenames
  As a software engineering resesearcher
  I want to know in which file each module is declared
  So that I can compare that with data from the VCS

  Scenario: C++, runing against some directory
    When I run "analizo metrics t/samples/animals/cpp"
    Then analizo must report that module Animal has _filename = [animal.h]
    And analizo must report that module Cat has _filename = [cat.h,cat.cc]

  Scenario: C++, running against current directory
    Given I am in t/samples/animals/cpp
    When I run "analizo metrics ."
    Then analizo must report that module Animal has _filename = [animal.h]
    And analizo must report that module Cat has _filename = [cat.h,cat.cc]

  Scenario: Java
    When I run "analizo metrics t/samples/animals/java"
    Then analizo must report that module Animal has _filename = [Animal.java]

  Scenario: C
    Given I am in t/samples/hello_world/c
    When I run "analizo metrics ."
    Then analizo must report that module hello_world has _filename = [hello_world.c,hello_world.h]
