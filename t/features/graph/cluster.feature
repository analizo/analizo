Feature: clustering subroutines in the same module together

  Scenario: clustering dependencies
    Given I am in t/samples/sample_basic/
    When I run "analizo graph --cluster ."
    Then analizo must report that "module1::main()" is part of "module1"
    Then analizo must report that "module2::say_hello()" is part of "module2"
    Then analizo must report that "module2::say_bye()" is part of "module2"
    Then analizo must report that "module3::variable" is part of "module3"
    Then analizo must report that "module3::callback()" is part of "module3"
